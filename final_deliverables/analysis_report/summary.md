# Language Efficiency Analysis: Summary of Findings

## Key Findings

- **Overall Efficiency**: Chinese reasoning is 2.70% more token-efficient than English reasoning across all benchmarks
- **Domain-Specific Efficiency**:
  - Mathematical problems (MATH): 28.95% efficiency gain with Chinese
  - Scientific reasoning (ARC): 2.72% efficiency gain with Chinese
  - Math word problems (GSM8K): 7.47% efficiency loss with Chinese
  - Logical deduction (BBH): 13.00% efficiency loss with Chinese
  - Reading comprehension (HotpotQA): 16.63% efficiency loss with Chinese
- **Difficulty Impact**:
  - Medium difficulty: 12.59% efficiency gain with Chinese
  - Hard difficulty: 4.50% efficiency loss with Chinese
- **Information Density**: Chinese has 54.43% lower bits-per-token than English

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Use Chinese reasoning for**:
   - Mathematical applications
   - Medium-complexity tasks
   - Cost-sensitive applications

2. **Use English reasoning for**:
   - Logical reasoning tasks
   - Reading comprehension
   - Very complex problems

3. **Consider hybrid approaches**:
   - Domain-selective language switching
   - Difficulty-based selection
   - Terminology preservation (English terms, Chinese reasoning)

## Implementation Strategy

1. Implement a classifier to determine problem type and difficulty
2. Apply Chinese reasoning only for problem types where it shows efficiency gains
3. Continuously monitor token usage and adjust language selection based on performance

## Conclusion

Chinese reasoning can improve token efficiency for chain-of-thought reasoning, but the benefits are highly domain-specific. A nuanced, domain-aware approach to language selection could yield meaningful efficiency improvements and cost savings.
