The student places a wooden block on a table and uses a spring scale to pull the block across the table at a constant speed. The student then places the same wooden block on a waxed floor and pulls it across the floor at the same constant speed. On which surface will the spring scale show a greater force is needed to move the block, and why?",

She performs the same reaction at 10째C, 20째C, 30째C, and 40째C, measuring the time it takes for the reaction to complete. The times recorded were 240 seconds, 120 seconds, 60 seconds, and 30 seconds, respectively. Based on this data, what can the scientist conclude about the relationship between temperature and reaction rate?",
