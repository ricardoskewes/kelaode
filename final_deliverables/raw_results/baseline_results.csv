The spring scale will show a greater force is needed to move the block across the table surface. This is because the table surface likely has a higher coefficient of friction compared to the smooth, waxed floor. The rougher texture of the table creates more resistance against the wooden block's motion, requiring more force to overcome this friction and maintain a constant speed. In contrast, the waxed floor's smooth surface offers less resistance, allowing the block to slide more easily with less applied force.",2025-03-01T23:58:14.496833,2649,442,0,0.0,19.185528893600882,0.41235392320534225,0.5825471698113207,4.42237061769616,0.0,1.0,1
